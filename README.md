# Hypothesis

News reader for the popular [Alternative Hypothesis](http://thealternativehypothesis.org/) news site using it's public RSS feed.

This app was made for the Android Basics Nanodegree.

Despite the project rubric instructed to use The Guardian API, and I dislike The Guardian, and I wanted to learn how can I read RSS feeds, I used my favourite news site and worked with that. For the sake of diversity.

Then the reviewer said it's a failure, so I implemented The Guardian way.
